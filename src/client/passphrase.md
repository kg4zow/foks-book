# Working with Passphrases

> &#x2139;&#xFE0F; This page is just a rough outline of what I want to cover.

Figure out

* how/when passphrases are used
* &#x2753; is a passphrase specific to just the key(s) on a single machine, or is it global to the entire account?
    * whitepaper talks about a case where if machine A changes a passphrase, the next login on machine B would need to use the new passphrase
* the `foks passphrase` and `foks secret-key-material` commands
