# Creating a User

* Select a server
    * defaults `foks.app` and `vh.foks.app` will be offered
        * these are a paid service, [w.foks.app](https://w.foks.app), offers virtual hosting (i.e. your own hostname, hosted on the `foks.app` server)
        * also usable for *simple* experimentation, each user has a very small usage limit (3 MiB)
    * other servers - list?
    * build/host your own server

* `foks signup`
    * walk through what the process looks like

* Create a backup key
    * explain why having a backup key is important

* Note about macOS Keychain &#x21D2; [Key Storage](key-storage.md) page
