# Introduction

This site is meant to serve as user-facing documentation for [FOKS](https://foks.pub/), the Federated Open Key Service.

If you're just learning about FOKS, you should probably start with the [Background](background.md) page. It explains several concepts that will make the rest of the site, make more sense.

>
> If you're seeing this message, this "book" is in the *very* early stages. I'm still trying to figure out what pages need to exist, how they should be structured, and how much detail they should go into.
>
> For now you can expect to see pages which don't exist yet, or which exist but have little or no real content. You will also see a lot of &#x2753; marks as well. Hopefully these will be filled in over time.
>
> It's possible that the pages within the book may be renamed, re-arranged, or deleted as time goes by, and if this happens, the URLs of the individual pages will change. If you're going to save bookmarks, I recommend you save *just* the URL for the site itself, rather than any individual page.
>
> If you're interested in helping to write or edit the book, start by reading the [Working on this Book](other/working-on-book.md) page, which walks through the basics of how to use mdbook.

## Chat

I've created the [foks_book](https://keybase.io/team/foks_book/) team on Keybase, and plan to use its "team chat" channel as a place for people to coordinate with each other and make sure we aren't duplicating each others' efforts.

If you're interested in working on this book, please join that team. The team is not fully open (I don't want to have to deal with spammers), but any Keybase user is able to *ask* to join, and I will try to approve people as quickly as possible (while I'm awake ... I'm physically in Florida, US, and regardless of what you may have heard, I *do* sometimes sleep at night. &#x1F601;)

If you have questions about FOKS that the book doesn't cover, *also* please join that team. Knowing what questions people are *asking* helps us to know what the book needs to cover, and if your question is *answered*, having the answer in the chat room's history can make it a easier when adding the information to the book.

Obviously, if FOKS adds a similar "chat room" functionality in the future, I'll create a team in FOKS and move the conversation there.
