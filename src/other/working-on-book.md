# Working on this Book

This page covers the "workflow" around how to work with this site.

The site itself is a collection of static HTML, CSS, and Javascript pages, generated by [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/). The "source code" for each page is a Markdown file.

mdbook has a feature where, while you're working on the source files, it will show and automatically update a copy of what the finished site will look like, in a browser on your local machine. This works by running a simple web server and watching the source files. When it sees a file change whose contents affect the site, it sends a signal to the browser, telling it to reload.


> &#x2139;&#xFE0F; **Coordination**
>
> I've created the [foks_book](https://keybase.io/team/foks_book/) team on Keybase, and plan to use its "team chat" channel as a place for people to coordinate with each other and make sure we aren't duplicating each others' efforts.
>
> If you're interested in working on this book, please join that team. If you have questions about FOKS that the book doesn't cover, *also* please join that team. Knowing what questions people are *asking* helps us to know what the book needs to cover.
>
> Obviously, if FOKS adds a similar "chat room" functionality in the future, I'll create a team in FOKS and move the conversation there.


## Repo Structure

The repo contains a collection of files which are involved in building the site. The files you'll be working with if you edit the book's content are:

* **`src/`** - This directory contains the Markdown source files for every page.

* **`src/SUMMARY.md`** - This file contains the Table of Contents for the site, and is used to build the panel on the left. It is a markdown file, however it only supports a limited set of tags.

    If you're using mdbook's live preview feature, if you add a new page to the list in this file and save it, mdbook will create the associated Markdown file if it doesn't already exist.

* **`book/`** - This directory contains the generated HTML, CSS, and other files which make up the rendered site. This directory is not meant to be checked into the repo, so it's listed in the repo's `.gitignore` file.

* **`book.toml`** - This file sets the overall properites of the book. This includes any custom steps to be performed in the rendering process.

This repo contains some customizations which aren't in normal mdbook books. These include a CSS stylesheet which adds horizontal lines *above* section headers (which I personally think makes it easier to read), as well as a script which is run during the rendering process to add the git commit information to the bottom of each page. [This repo](https://github.com/kg4zow/mdbook-template) has more information about these customizations.


## Pre-requisites

The only thing you really *need* in order to work on the site is a text editor.

Your text editor should support [Editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/). If it requires a plugin, it should be installed and enabled. If your editor doesn't have a way to support editorconfig at all (such as `nano`), you should manually follow the rules laid out in the `.editorconfig` file, and use [editorconfig-checker](https://github.com/editorconfig-checker/editorconfig-checker) to check your files before committing them.

### Live Preview

If you want to use mdbook's "live preview" feature, the following things will need to be installed on your workstation.

* [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)

* [jq](https://jqlang.org/)

* A browser, to preview the changes as you save them.

These are explained in more detail [here](https://github.com/kg4zow/mdbook-template?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-requisites), in the `mdbook-template` repo.

## Workflow

This is the overall workflow to use while working on the book.

### Setup

* If you haven't already, "fork" the repo into your own Github account. You'll be making your changes in your own *copy* of the repo.

    &#x21D2; [Github Documentation - Fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

* If you already have a forked copy of the repo, make sure your fork is up-to-date with all commits from the main repo.

    &#x21D2; [Github Documentation - Syncing a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)

* If you haven't already, clone your copy of the repo to your workstation.

    ```
    cd ~/git/
    git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME foks-book
    ```

* `cd` into the directory where you cloned the repo, and make sure it's up to date with the Github repo.

    ```
    cd ~/git/foks-book/
    git fetch -p
    git checkout main
    git pull
    ```

* Create a new branch to contain the changes you're working on.

    ```
    cd ~/git/foks-book
    git checkout -b new-branch-name
    ```

### Edit

* If you want to see the live preview while you're working, run `make serve` (or the appropriate `mdbook serve` command). This will render the book from Markdown into HTML, start a web server *on your workstation*, and open a browser pointing to that web server.

    This web server normally listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`, which means the pages it's serving will only be accessible from the same machine.

    > The IP address and port number can be changed if needed. For example, if you make it listen on `0.0.0.0` (which is what  `make serve-all` does), any machine which can access your workstation will be able to view the pages. You will obviously want to be careful with this.

    **Leave this command running while you're working.**

* Edit the files under the `src/` directory as needed.

    If you're using the live preview feature, visit the page(s) you're updating in the browser and make sure your changes are correct. Each time you save a file, the browser should automatically reload.

### Commit, Push, and Create a Pull Request

After you're happy with the proposed changes ..,

* If you're using the live preview feature, go back to the window where the mdbook web server is running, and hit CONTROL-C to stop it.

* Commit your changes and push the new branch to *your repo*.

    ```
    cd ~/git/foks-book/
    git add src/
    git commit -m 'Update information about XYZ'
    git push -u origin new-branch-name
    ```

* The output from the `git push` command should contain a URL to create a pull request. Visit this URL to create a pull request.

    In the grey bar above "Add a title", make sure that ...

    * "base" should point to the `foks-proj/book` repo
    * "compare" should point to the branch you created in your repo


    &#x21D2; [Github Documentation - Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

### Review and Merge

* At this point, other Github users will be able to see the pull request, and offer comments on it.

* If you want to update your proposed changes, create and push another commit to the same branch, in your repo. Github will will update the pull request to include those changes automatically.

* People can also "approve" the pull request. This simply means that they've looked over the changes and don't see any problems with them.

* When the repo owners decide that they're good with the changes, they can merge the pull request. This adds the commits from your branch, to the primary repo.

* Within a few minutes after this happens, the web site containing the rendered book will be updated automatically.
