# FOKS User Guide

User documentation for [FOKS](https://foks.pub/)

## About this book

For now, this is a skeleton of how the user guide could be organized. Anything and everything about this book is subject to being re-organized or re-written.

I'm starting this "book" using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), with some customizations from [this repo](https://github.com/kg4zow/mdbook-template/). This is because ...

* The content is written using Markdown, which is a commonly used language for documentation. It's simple to work with, and is human-readable on its own.

* The mdbook program has a simple web server built into it, which allows you to see what the finished page will look like. Every time you save a file, the browser window reloads itself automatically.

* The output is all static files, mostly HTML and CSS with a few Javascript files. Because of this, the resulting site can be hosted on any hosting platform.

* I'm familiar with it. I would rather spend my time writing documentation than playing around with the framework for *publishing* that documentation.

* If Max decides to use something else to host the book later on, it should be fairly simple to copy the Markdown files to whatever the new system is.

Others are more than welcome to help with writing this documentation. [This page](src/other/working-on-book.md) (which is part of the book's content) explains how to fork the repo, work with mdbook, and create a pull request with your changes.


## About me

**I am NOT a FOKS developer**. I *have* been programming for over 40 years, but I don't have a background in deep cryptography, and I'm just *barely* above beginner level with the Go language. (My best languages are Perl, Puppet, and C, in that order.)

I'm just a user who wants to do what I can to help FOKS succeed. I seem to be pretty good at writing documentation, so I *kinda* volunteered to start this user guide.
